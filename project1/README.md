  Department of Computer Science, EPF Lausanne, Switzerland

## Repo structure:
You may find the relevent files in the root of the repo:
- data-exploration-notebooks: In these folders you may find legacy code that helped us analyse and visualize the data
## Running the code:
- Make sure to enable you virtual environnement (penv or conda).
- Make sure to have dependencies (Available in the environement.yml)
- Run with your default python interpreter the run.py
- (Additional: For Roc graphs, which are very verbose, uncommenting line 47 of run.py will yield them.)
- Additional: For finding the best alpha for the predictions of the best model you may uncomment lines 251-258 in run.py . This is very verbose and pointless.


## Expected outputs
The code will output to stdout periodically about its progress and its results.
You will find the predictions file in $PROJECT_PATH/out/submission.csv
